# Prepaid Energy Meter

Build a demo prepaid energy metering system with Arduino or any compatible Atmel microcontroller and a current sensor. Also syncs data to Blynk IoT Cloud platform or to a SD card locally at interval. Code is well commented for easier editing.

Here are the list of modules used in this project:

* Arduino Mega2560 (ATMega2560) or any other compatible Atmel microcontroller.
* LCD 2004 (20 x 4 LCD) for data display.
* 4 x 4 Keypad module for user input and queries.
* SD card module to locally log data.
* ACS712 current sensor to measure current readings.
* SIM800L module for GPRS connection to Blynk Cloud.
